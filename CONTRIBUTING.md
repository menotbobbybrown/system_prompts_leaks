## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Finding Something to Work On
Look for open issues labeled:
- `good first issue` — Great starting points for newcomers.
- `help wanted` — Features or refactors that need extra hands.
- `bug` — Verified issues that need patches.

If you have a new feature idea, feel free to open a [Feature Request Issue](https://github.com/menotbobbybrown/system_prompts_leaks/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) first to discuss architecture before writing code.

### 2. Developing Your Change

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Follow Coding & Architecture Guidelines:**
   - Write clean, modular TypeScript with strict type safety.
   - Ensure all public functions and classes have clear JSDoc docstrings.
   - Avoid external heavyweight dependencies — keep bundle sizes minimal.
   - Maintain security standards (prevent SSRF, path traversals, command injections, and input deserialization flaws).

3. **Add Automated Tests:**
   - Every bug fix must include a reproducing unit test in the `tests/` directory.
   - Every new feature must have high test coverage (>90%).
   - Verify that all tests pass locally:
     ```bash
     npm test
     npm run build
     ```

### 3. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

   Use clear, conventional commit messages:
   - `feat: add support for streaming tool responses`
   - `fix: resolve edge-case in BM25 token allocation`
   - `docs: update quickstart instructions`
   - `test: add security unit test for path traversal`

2. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click **"Compare & pull request"**.
   - Fill out the provided [Pull Request Template](.github/pull_request_template.md).
   - Link any related issue (e.g. `Closes #12`).

4. **Code Review:**
   - Maintainers will review your PR, run CI/CD verification workflows, and provide feedback.
   - Once approved, your PR will be squash-merged into `main`!
